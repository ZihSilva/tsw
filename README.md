Project mande for the second project of IronHack's Web Development bootcamp SÃ£o Paulo - Remote.

TSW is a project thinking of woman safety travelling alone. On our website the countries are ranked by safety and travelers can share their experience travelling in that country.

We use **ReactJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript** and the libraries **axios, ant design, materal UI and grommet**.
